/* Summary:  This main.cpp will create an empty linked list, populate the linked list with contents from a file opened in the main.cpp and create single nodes at the end of the list if the linked list is full and needs more room at the end of the linked list.  A struct is created before main() so that nodes may be created for the linked list.  main.cpp will output into stdout a plain text list of the contents of the linked list.
