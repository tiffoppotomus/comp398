#README.md
This program is a converter from Markdown to HTML.
This folder contains the files:
* main.cpp
* markdownSampleFile.md
* output.html
* README.md

This program is in working condition but isn’t complete. Converting the block quotes and lists are done and only the headers using the atx—style works.  Horizontal lines can be made but it gets printed as a list with two asterisks afterwords after the line is converted into html. Images and links are still in markdown format.
