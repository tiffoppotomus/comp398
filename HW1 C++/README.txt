This program has a Linker Error, and 3 semantic issues I wasn’t sure how to fix.  This project contains a main.cpp, Node.cpp, Node.h, and a flat file database, ListOfBeyonceFilms.txt where the main.cpp extracts information from.  The program is able to open and read the text file, however when attempting to implement a Node class, the Linker Error appeared and I wasn’t sure what this Error indicated.  I tried to continue on “ignoring” the Liner error, meaning try to program the node.cpp and node.h to implement a linked list, but other errors came up.
