This program contains a main.cpp.  In the main.cpp, a struct Node is created with a text and a next section.  This is used to create a linked list in int main().  In the main program, a file is opened to read and will be later used to populate an empty linked list.  The program can so far open and read a file and an empty linked list is created.  However, populating the linked list has yet to be accomplished.
